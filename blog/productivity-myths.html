        <h2>It's been a while...</h2>
        <p>
        For roughly 5 years I've been into this sh*t, and the time has become to change perspective.
        </p>
        <h2>How do I get there?</h2>
        <p>
        It all started with a YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcaTUtGzOiS4cqrgtcsHYWg">jvscholz</a>.
        He used to work 12 hours a day, streaming his process. However, I got hooked not to his streams, but to his "productivity workflow" kind of videos.
        I really love technology, and found his videos so interesting, that I watched all of them. 
        That had (suprise!) no effect on my life, but I started to look for more videos like this. And I found them. I ended up being stuck at ...

        <h2>Cycle of self-improvment</h2>
        <pre>
            Nutshell -> Motivation -> Hustle!
                /\(you can get everything,||
                || just do the hard work  ||
                || like I am)             \/
                ----------------------------
        </pre>
        <p>
        This "concept" describes everything. It's how the brain works. 
        The part "like I am", however, describes me exclusively, because I always tried to have someone to look up from.
        I don't know, how many iterations I have passed, but I'm sure that there were more than 100 of them.

        <h2>Focus at "gurus"</h2>
        <p>
        I don't really think that everyone, who promotes some kind of self-help, self-improvment and productivity things is a bad person.
        However, a lot of them are not willing to help you. Everything they want is to make money on you.
        Bloggers make money on ads and maybe their own persona. Self-help books writers make money on their's books sells. And so on.
        Even jvscholz is trying to make money on you, selling his "Zen Planner" and promoting film with him in the cast.
        Some gurus create clubs,
