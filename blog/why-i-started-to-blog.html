        Year ago I stumbled on the video called "Basic Guide to Personal Web", and I really liked the idea of the personal web. 
        I created Github Pages website and even created one blogpost about where did the basic Hello World! programm came from. 
        But this was the only post I written, and week I deleted the website. 
        I didn't know what to write and I was so shy that I could live with a thought that some bad guys could read this and think how bad this blog actually was. 
    </p>
    <p>
        But know something changed. 
        I feel more confidient about it.
        I want to help people with knowledge I have. I want share my thought and views with people.
        Finally, I'm looking forward to meeting cool people here.
