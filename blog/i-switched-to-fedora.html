        <h1>I switched to Fedora GNU/Linux</h1>
        <a href="../index.html">Take me home!</a>
        <p>
            For the last two months I was using Fedora Linux instead of NixOS,
            and I kinda liked it. Right now I am not planning to return to Nix.
            So, the question arises: Why?
        </p>
        <img src="../img/f*ck-ricers.webp" />
        <p>
            Because I have some stuff to be done, and I don't want to waste my
            life configuring some feature X, if it was already configured by
            someone else. Now, that's the beauty of GNU/Linux and free software
            in general: you can choose, whether to trust someones software or
            not, or how it was configured. If you are anti-systemd, for example,
            go ahead and choose the distro without it. That's the power you
            should ideally have over your software.
        </p>
        <h2>People, who complicate ordinary things</h2>
        <p>
            There are people, who cherish their vim/neovim/emacs/dwm/etc.
            configs on the Internet. They pray for minimalist, CLI programs,
            they use old ThinkPads, etc. I don't know, which of them are
            familiar to you, but I personally think, that the good example of
            this kind of people can be Luke Smith. He has some
            <i><b>extreme</b></i>
            views not only on the software, but on everything. This is, however,
            not the point. The points is, many people, who spend many many hours
            painstakingly configuring their OSes, are not even people, who are
            related to actual programming. They don't write a lot of code, so
            they have time to write their configs. Why would you recreate the
            bicycle from scratch, if you already have a variety of bikes that
            are any shape and colors you would ever imagine? I suppose, only for
            educational purposes, to realize, how that thing works, etc.
        </p>
        <h2>Important: that is all my opinion, and nothing more than that</h2>
        <p>
            I might be wrong, actually. There were times, when I was overwhelmed
            with modern software complexity. For example, I hate running server
            stuff in Docker, because it's too high on server's resources, and it
            it sometimes not as easy as just configuring everything manually.
        </p>
        <h2>How I choose software</h2>
        <p>
            When I choose software, I ask myself: "Will it simplify my life?".
            That is all.
        </p>
        <h2>PS: I eventually switched to Kubuntu, because Fedora is broken on my hardware.</h2>
